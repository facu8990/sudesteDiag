# sudesteDiag - Roadmap

### Implement New Project Management Model

> This milestone will be done when 
* The new PM model is stable and ratified by all the sudesteDiag-related milestones

This will allow us to then assemble our first Organization Roadmap.

We want to have this done before the Q4 Quarterly Meeting so that we can use this new PM model during that meeting.
